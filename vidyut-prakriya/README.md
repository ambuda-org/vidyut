<h1><code>vidyut-prakriya</code></h1>
<p><i>A Paninian word generator</i></p>
</div>

`vidyut-prakriya` generates Sanskrit words with their prakriyās (derivations)
according to the rules of Paninian grammar. Our long-term goal is to provide a
complete implementation of the Ashtadhyayi.

Overview
--------

`vidyut-prakriya` has three distinguishing qualities:

1. *Fidelity*. We follow the rules of Paninian grammar as closely as possible.
   Each word we return can optionally include a prakriyā that lists each rule
   that was used as well as its result.

2. *Speed*. On my laptop (a 2.4GHz 8-core CPU with 64 GB of DDR4 RAM), this
   crate generates almost 100,000 words per second. All else equal, a fast
   program is easier to run and test, which means that we can produce a larger
   word list at a higher standard of quality.

3. *Portability*. This crate compiles to fast native code and can be bound to
   most other progamming languages with a bit of effort. In particular, this
   crate can be compiled to WebAssembly, which means that it can run in a
   modern web browser.

`vidyut-prakriya` currently has strong support for basic verbs. For future plans,
see our [roadmap](#roadmap).


Usage
-----

To generate all basic tinantas in kartari prayoga, run:

```shell
$ make create_tinantas > output.csv
```

The first run of `make create_tinantas` will be slow since your machine must
first compile `vidyut-prakriya`. After this initial compilation step, however,
subsequent runs will be much faster, and `make create_tinantas` will likely
compile and complete within a few seconds.

To generate prakriyas programmatically, you can use the starter code below:

```rust
use vidyut_prakriya::Ashtadhyayi;
use vidyut_prakriya::args::*;

let a = Ashtadhyayi::new();

let dhatu = Dhatu::new("BU", Gana::Bhvadi);
let args = TinantaArgs::builder()
    .lakara(Lakara::Lat)
    .prayoga(Prayoga::Kartari)
    .purusha(Purusha::Prathama)
    .vacana(Vacana::Eka)
    .build().unwrap();

let prakriyas = a.derive_tinantas(&dhatu, &args);

for p in prakriyas {
    println!("{}", p.text());
    println!("---------------------------");
    for step in p.history() {
        println!("{:<10} | {}", step.rule(), step.result());
    }
    println!("---------------------------");
    println!("\n");
}
```

Output of the code above:

```text
Bavati
---------------------------
start      | BU
1.3.1      | BU
3.3.123    | BU + la~w
1.3.2      | BU + la~w
1.3.3      | BU + la~w
1.3.9      | BU + l
1.3.78     | BU + l
3.4.78     | BU + tip
1.3.3      | BU + tip
1.3.9      | BU + ti
3.4.113    | BU + ti
3.1.68     | BU + Sap + ti
1.3.3      | BU + Sap + ti
1.3.8      | BU + Sap + ti
1.3.9      | BU + a + ti
3.4.113    | BU + a + ti
7.3.84     | Bo + a + ti
6.1.78     | Bav + a + ti
---------------------------
```

The left column shows a simple string label for each rule that was applied
during the derivation, and you can find details about what values these labels
can take in the comments on the `Rule` type. We suggest using `ashtadhyayi.com`
to learn more about these rules.

The right column shows the in-progress prakriya. We use an output convention
that is common on other Ashtadhyayi websites. The encoding foromat for this
text is SLP1, which is the encoding format we use throughout the crate.

Contributing
------------

`vidyut-prakriya` is an ambitious project, and your contributions can help it
grow.

### Reporting errors

The easiest way to help is to [file a GitHub issue][gh-issue] if you notice an
error. Please let us know what form you expected to see. We would also greatly
appreciate relevant citations from the grammatical literature so that we can
better understand and resolve the issue.

[gh-issue]: https://github.com/ambuda-org/vidyut-pada-snapshot/issues

### Modifying the code

First, see if you can run our existing code on your machine. We suggest
that you start by running our integration tests:

```shell
$ make create_test_files
$ make test_all
```

Next, try using our prakriya debugger, which shows exactly how a given word was
derived:

```shell
# Explain a tinanta
$ cargo run --bin explain_tinanta -- --code 01.0001 --pada Bavati

# Explain a krdanta
$ cargo run --bin explain_tinanta -- --code 01.0001 --krt ktvA --pratipadika BUtvA
```

Once you've confirmed that your setup works, we suggest that you read through
the documentation for `Term` (in the `term` module) and `Prakriya` (in the
`prakriya` module). Almost every part of the code touches these two structs.

To get familiar with our rules, we suggest that you skim through the
`ashtadhyayi` module, which defines our high-level API and wraps all of the
rules that we use in the system. We encourage you to read our extensive
comments and explore the smaller modules that we use within `ashtadhyayi`.

Now you're ready to make changes to the code. After you make your changes, run
`make test_all` to verify the impact of your code.

If you are satisfied with your changes, you will need to update our integration
test file. This process has three steps. First, run the steps below and confirm
that your tests fail:

```shell
$ make create_test_files
$ make test_all
```

`make test_all` should fail on a hash comparison error. Copy the new hash code,
replace the existing hash code in the `test_all` in our `Makefile` with that
copied value. Then, run `make test_all` again and confirm that all tests pass.

Design
------

`vidyut-prakriya` follows the form and spirit of the Ashtadhyayi as closely as
possible. At the same time, we make certain concessions to pragmatism so that
we can build a clear and maintainable program. For example, instead of
selecting a rule according to principles like `utsarga-apavAda`, we instead
manually reorder rules so that we can run a simple imperative program.

Our main data structure is a `Term`, which generalizes the उपदेश concept from
traditional grammar. `Term` is simply a string with useful metadata and a rich
API. For details, see the `term` module.

We manage the overall derivation with a `Prakriya`, which is a `Vec<Term>` along
with useful metadata and a rich API. `Prakriya` also maintains a log of which
steps have been applied in the derivation. For details, see the `prakriya`
module.

Both `Term` and `Prakriya` are annotated with `Tag`s, which generalize the संज्ञा
concept from  traditional grammar. For details, see the `tag` module.

In general, our rules are implemented as simple if-else statements. For example:

```rust,ignore
fn rules(p: &mut Prakriya, i: usize) -> Option<()> {
    let tin = p.get_if(i, |t| t.has_adi('J'))?;

    let i_base = p.find_prev_where(i, |t| !t.is_empty())?;
    let base = p.get(i_base)?;

    if base.has_tag(T::Abhyasta) {
        // juhvati
        p.op_term("7.1.4", i, op::adi("at"));
    } else if !base.has_antya('a') && tin.has_tag(T::Atmanepada) {
        // kurvate
        p.op_term("7.1.5", i, op::adi("at"));
    } else {
        // Bavanti
        p.op_term("7.1.3", i, op::adi("ant"));
    }

    Some(())
}
```

Since we have so many rules to write, we use short variable names as long as
they don't sacrifice readability. Some notes on our naming conventions:

- `p` is a `Prakriya`.
- `i` is the index of a term in the prakriya. We use indices often so that we
  can [better accommodate Rust's borrow checker][rust-borrow].
- `t` is a `Term`.
- `?` is a [Rust operator][rust-q] that roughly means "return if not found."
- `T` is an alias for `Tag`.
- `op` is an alias for `operators`, a module that contains common operations
  that we apply to terms during the derivation.

Notes on our API:

- `p.op_term("my-rule", i, fn)` applies the `fn` function to the term at index `i`
  of `p` and associates that operation with `"my-rule"`.
- `op::adi(s)` returns a function. The returned function accepts a `Term` and
  replaces its first sound with `s`. If you haven't worked with [first-class
  functions][funcs] before, you might find this API strange at first. But in
  time, we hope that you find it to be as expressive and powerful as we do.

Roadmap
-------

*(This section uses Paninian terms that might be difficult for a general reader to
understand.)*

For tinantas, we aim to produce all valid combinations of (`upasarga`, `dhatu`,
`sanadi`, `prayoga`, `purusha`, `vacana`, `lakara`, `pada`), where:

- `upasarga` is a group of zero or more upasargas, focusing on common
  combinations.
- `dhatu` is a mUla-dhAtu (basic verb root) from the Dhatupatha.
- `sanadi` is an optional *san*, *nic*, *yan*, or *yan-luk* pratyaya.
- `purusha` is one of {prathama, madhyama, uttama}
- `vacana` is one of {ekavacana, dvivacana, bahuvacana}
- `lakara` is any lakara, excluding `let`.

For krt-subantas, we aim to produce all valid combinations of (`upasarga`, `dhatu`,
`sanadi`, `krt`, `linga`, `vibhakti`, `vacana`), where:

- `upasarga`, `dhatu`, and `sanadi` are as above.
- `krt` is any `krt`-pratyaya introduced in the Ashtadhyayi, including the
  uNAdi-sUtras but excluding chAndasa usage. 
- `linga` is one of {pum, stri, napumsaka}
- `vibhakti` is one of the seven vibhaktis or sambodhana.
- `vacana` is as above.

For all other subantas, we aim to produce all valid combinations of
(`pratipadika`, `linga`, `vibhakti`, `vacana`), where:

- `pratipadika` is a stem listed in a standard dictionary.
- `linga`, `vibhakti`, and `vacana` are as above.
