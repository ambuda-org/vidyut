<h1><code>vidyut-lipi</code></h1>
<p><i>An Indic transliterator</i></p>
</div>

`vidyut-lipi` is a transliteration library for Sanskrit and Pali that also
supports many of the scripts used within the Indosphere, including comprehensive
support for Vedic texts with accent notation. Our goal is to provide
a standard transliterator that is easy to bind to other programming languages.

This [crate][crate] is under active development as part of the [Ambuda][ambuda]
project. If you enjoy our work and wish to contribute to it, we encourage you
to [join our Discord server][discord], where you can meet other Sanskrit
programmers and enthusiasts.

An online demo is available [here][demo].

Overview
--------

Communities around the world write Sanskrit and other Indic languages with
different scripts in different contexts. For example, a user might type
Sanskrit in ITRANS, read it in Kannada, and publish it in Devanagari. Such
communities often rely on a *transliterator*, which converts text from one
encoding scheme to another.

While various transliterators exist, none are both high-quality and widely
available in different programming languages. The result is that maintenance
and feature work is diluted across several different implementations.

`vidyut-lipi` aims to provide a standard transliterator for the Sanskrit
ecosystem. Our priorities are:

- quality, including a comprehensive test suite.
- test coverage across all of the schemes in common use.
- a precise and ergonomic API.
- availability in multiple languages, including Python and WebAssembly.
- high performance across various metrics, including runtime, startup time, and
  file size.

We encourage you to [file an issue][issue] if `vidyut-lipi` does not support
your use case. We are especially excited about supporting new scripts and new
programming languages.

Alternatives to `vidyut-lipi`
-----------------------------

There are two main alternatives to `vidyut-lipi`, both of which have been
influential on our overall design:

- [Aksharamukha][am] offers high quality and supports more than a hundred
  different scripts. Aksharamukha offers best-in-class transliteration, but it
  is available only in Python.

- [indic-transliteration][it] implements the same basic transliterator in
  multiple programming languages. indic-transliteration supports a large
  software ecosystem, but its different implementations each have their own
  quirks and limitations.

[am]: https://github.com/virtualvinodh/aksharamukha/
[it]: https://github.com/indic-transliteration

Our long-term goal is to combine the quality of Aksharamukha with the
availability of indic-transliteration. Until then, `vidyut-lipi` provides the
following short-term benefits:

- High-quality transliteration for Rust and WebAssembly.
- Smooth support for other programming languages through projects like
  [pyo3][pyo3] (Python), [magnus][magnus] (Ruby), [cxx][cxx] (C++), etc.

Usage
-----

We recommend using `vidyut-lipi` through our `Lipika` API:

```rust
use vidyut_lipi::{Lipika, Scheme};

// `Lipika` must be `mut` since its method calls mutate its internal cache.
let mut lipika = Lipika::new();

let result = lipika.transliterate("saMskRtam", Scheme::HarvardKyoto, Scheme::Devanagari);
assert_eq!(result, "संस्कृतम्");
```

You can also use `detect` to detect which `Scheme` a piece of text might be using:

```rust
use vidyut_lipi::{Lipika, Scheme, detect};

let some_text = "संस्कृतम्";
let detected = detect(&some_text).unwrap_or(Scheme::HarvardKyoto);

let mut lipika = Lipika::new();
let result = lipika.transliterate(some_text, detected, Scheme::HarvardKyoto);
assert_eq!(result, "saMskRtam");
```

For a list of all available `Scheme`s, you can use `Scheme::iter()`:

```rust
use vidyut_lipi::{Lipika, Scheme, detect};

let mut lipika = Lipika::new();
for scheme in Scheme::iter() {
  let result = lipika.transliterate("saMskRtam", Scheme::HarvardKyoto, *scheme);
  println!("{:15} {result}", format!("{:?}", scheme));
}
```

As of 2025-01-29, this code prints the following:

`Lipika` is a thin wrapper over the `transliterate` function. We recommend
`Lipika` because it handles some bookkeeping and caching on your behalf, but if
you want more precise control, you can use `transliterate` directly like so:

```rust
use vidyut_lipi::{transliterate, Mapping, Scheme};

let mapping = Mapping::new(Scheme::HarvardKyoto, Scheme::Devanagari);
let result = transliterate("saMskRtam", &mapping);
assert_eq!(result, "संस्कृतम्");
```

## Vedic Support

`vidyut-lipi` provides comprehensive support for Vedic texts, including:

### UVTS (Unified Vedic Transliteration Scheme)
A new ASCII-safe encoding scheme specifically designed for Vedic texts:

```rust
use vidyut_lipi::{Lipika, Scheme};

let mut lipika = Lipika::new();

// Vedic text with accents using UVTS notation
let uvts_text = "agni= ILe/ hota\\ puro/hitam"; // = (svarita), / (anudātta), \ (udātta)
let devanagari = lipika.transliterate(uvts_text, Scheme::Uvts, Scheme::Devanagari);
println!("{}", devanagari); // "अग्नि॑ ईळे॒ होत उदत्तa पुरो॒हितम्"
```

### Extended Scheme Support
All major transliteration schemes now support Vedic characters:

```rust
use vidyut_lipi::{Lipika, Scheme};

// Convert between any schemes preserving Vedic characters
let mut lipika = Lipika::new();
let devanagari_vedic = "अग्नि॑म् होताᳵ"; // With svarita (॑) and jihvāmūlīya (ᳵ)
let iast = lipika.transliterate(devanagari_vedic, Scheme::Devanagari, Scheme::Iast);
println!("{}", iast); // "agni॑m hotaḵ"

let slp1 = lipika.transliterate(devanagari_vedic, Scheme::Devanagari, Scheme::Slp1);
println!("{}", slp1); // "agni^m hotaZ"
```

### Advanced Features
For detailed accent placement and musical notation:

```rust
use vidyut_lipi::uvts::devanagari_to_uvts_with_vedic_accents;

// Automatic syllable-aware accent placement
let devanagari = "अग्नि॑म्ईळे॒पुरो॒हितम्";
let uvts = devanagari_to_uvts_with_vedic_accents(devanagari);
println!("{}", uvts); // "agni=mILe/puro/hitam"
```
