<p><i>Vidyut's Python bindings</i></p>
</div>

This directory provides Python bindings for Vidyut. Our work here focuses
specifically on Rust-Python conversion and *not* on the underlying logic.
This means we focus on:

- improving comments, documentation, and type hints
- adding better error messages
- making our API more exhaustive
- making our API more Pythonic
- adding extensive tests for our Rust-Python conversions
